This version of the TallyArbiter listener is an expanded and improved version of the original TTGO_T listener.
It has a LANC interface to partial control a Sony camera (or other camera's with a LANC interface). With commands in the chat function of TallyArbiter you can zoom the camera and start/stop the recording of the camera. The listener sends back a recording status message in the chat function of TallyArbiter.
It also has a TCP server for connection with the PTZOptics app (https://ptzoptics.com/app-download/). With this app you also can zoom the camera and start/stop recording. I use the preset 7 and 8 for the start and stop recoding command. 
Bitfocus Companion users can use the visca_2 (visca PTZoptics) connection for the same camera control.

The case is a bit larger to hold the extra pcb and battery and I redesigned the front.
The LANC connection has a loop through, so you also can attach a remote control.
